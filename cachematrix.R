## Module for working with matrices and their inverse where inverted matrices 
## are cached for performance reasons.

## Create a new instance of a matrix which can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Solve a matrix such that if it was already solved (inverted) before a cached answer is returned instead of
## doing all the calculations again. Any answer calculated will be cached.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
